## ⚙️ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hsinidev/legal-contracts-generator.git
    cd legal-contracts-generator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses a standard web setup. You will need a local server to run it. If you have Node.js, you can use `npx`:

    npm install -g serve
    ```
